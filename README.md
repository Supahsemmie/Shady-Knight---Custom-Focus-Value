# Shady-Knight---Custom-Focus-Value

Changes the slowdown multiplier of Shady Knight's focus feature. 

Default value for this mod is 0.25 (25% speed) and can be configured to whatever you want by changing the number after "FocusScale" in `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Shady Knight\BepInEx\config\sem.shadyknight.Custom_Focus_Value.cfg`.

You will need to boot up the game with the mod installed once for the config file to appear in your BepInEx folder.

# Note

While the game is running with this mod, you will not be able to change the focus multiplier within the in-game menu anymore. To change it again, you have to close the game and change the value in the config file before rebooting.
